            * A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,was born on October 15,1931,in Rameswaram,Tamil Nadu,India.<br><br>

            * In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.<br><br>
            
            * Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <strong>"Missile Man."</strong>
            
            * Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.<br><br>
            
            * He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br>
            
            * From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientifie adviser (1999-2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.<br><br>
            
            * His prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.<br><br>
            
            * In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.<br><br>
            
            * Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from <strong>40</strong> universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <strong>Padma Bhushan in 1981</strong> and the <strong>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</strong> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.<br><br>

            * In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.<br><br>

            * In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".<br><br>

            * Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <strong>Kalam Island</strong> in September 2015.<br><br>

            * A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <strong>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</strong> in August 2015.<br><br>

            * In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.<br><br>
